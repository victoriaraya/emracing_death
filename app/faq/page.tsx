      <h2 className="text-2xl pb-2">
        Are there fees for your services? Do you take insurance?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-xl pb-4">
        Yes there is a charge. End-of-life doula services are not converd by
        Medicare or other insurance. Instead, such services, like other
        companion/caregiver type services are typically paid for by individuals
        and families as an out-of-pocket private expense. There are discounts
        available if you choose multiple services. Payment plans are available
        as well. I can work with all budgets. Please contact me today to
        schedule a free consultation.

        What is the difference between a hospice volunteer and an end-of-life
        doula?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-xl pb-4">
        The death doula's service do not take the place of hospice personnel;
        rather they complement other services that a dying person and their
        family may be receiving buy providing additional support and community
        resources for end of life care for the patient and their families. There
        are laws governing what death doulas can and cannot do. <br />
        Hospice volunteers are mandated by Medicare law and the hospice care
        providers' hours are regulated by Medicare. Medicare law requiers that
        volunteer hours equal at least five percent of the hospice provider's
        total patient care hours.

        How does Death Doula support differ from the support provided by
        hospice?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-xl pb-4">
        End-of-life Doula services can enhance traditional care by offering an
        additional layer of support and are available before, during and any
        time after death.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl pb-2">
        Can an End-of-Life Doula work with hospice, hospice staff, or Home
        Healthcare Aides in the care of a loved one?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-xl pb-4">
        Yes. Patients are their families often need greater support in the final
        days of life. End-of-life doulas are not employed by the hospice
        agencies and often do not face the same time constraints as hospice
        providers and can stay with the patient longer. End-of-life doulas can
        help hospices' efforts to improve health equity in hard to reach
        settings while also improving quality in the last days of life by
        providing a layer of support and helping prepare people for death by
        opening up conversations about it, as well as providing comfort and
        resources.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl pb-2">
        Who regulates or organizes regulating standards for the End-of-life
        Doula profession?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-xl pb-4">
        {`National End-of-life Doula Alliance (NEDA) has set a national
        practicum with Core Competencies for the practice of professional
        End-of-life Doulas.`}
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl pb-2">What is End-of-Life planning?</h2>
      <p className="text-xl pb-4">
        Plans made for you by you to help your loved ones at the end of your
        life. Going through the end-of-life arrangements is very emotional and
