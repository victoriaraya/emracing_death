    question:
      "What is the difference between a hospice volunteer and an end-of-life doula?",
    answer:
      " The death doula's service do not take the place of hospice personnel; rather they complement other services that a dying person and their family may be receiving buy providing additional support and community resources for end of life care for the patient and their families. There are laws governing what death doulas can and cannot do. Hospice volunteers are mandated by Medicare law and the hospice care providers' hours are regulated by Medicare. Medicare law requires that volunteer hours equal at least five percent of the hospice provider's total patient care hours. An End-of-life Doula can spend as much time with a patient or family as they choose. We can do almost everything to assist with the care of your loved ones except give medication or any form of medical care as doulas are not medical personnel.",

    question:
      "How does Death Doula support differ from the support provided by hospice?",
    answer:
      "Death doulas are different from hospice or palliative care because they do not provide medical care or participate in physician-assisted death. Instead, death doulas work in conjunction with hospice programs to provide interpersonal, social, logistical and spiritual guidance that complements the care they receive in hospice. End-of-life Doula services can enhance traditional care by offering an additional layer of support and are available before, during and any time after death. We are here as long as the family needs us.",

    question:
      "Can an End-of-Life Doula work with hospice, hospice staff, or Home Healthcare Aides in the care of a loved one?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Patients and their families often need greater support in the final days of life. End-of-life doulas are not employed by the hospice agencies and often do not face the same time constraints as hospice providers and can stay with the patient longer. An end-of-life doula can notify the hospice team of any changes in the patient so that hospice staff can assess and update the care plan for maximum daily comfort of the patient. They can help hospices' efforts to improve health equity in hard to reach settings while also improving quality in the last days of life by providing a layer of support and helping prepare people for death by opening up conversations about it, as well as providing comfort and resources. It is important to remember end-of-life doulas are not employed by hospice.",

    question: "What about funeral assistance, vigils and other arrangements?",
    answer:
      "An End-of-life Doula can help with many things from the beginning stages of the dying process to helping the patients and families as death becomes more imminent. We can also help with vigils at time of death, after death care, understanding and honoring grief and finally recovery of life after loss.
